<strong>WGAST</strong> (Weakly-Supervised Generative Network for Daily 10 m Land Surface Temperature Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion) is a novel deep learning framework for spatio-temporal fusion of satellite images to estimate Land Surface Temperature (LST) at 10â€¯m resolution on a daily basis. WGAST addresses the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution in remote sensing by combining observations from Terra MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. It is built on a conditional generative adversarial architecture and integrates multi-level feature extraction, cosine similarity, normalization, temporal attention mechanisms, and noise suppression within an end-to-end design. WGAST is trained using a weakly-supervised strategy based on physical principles and adversarial learning, and demonstrates strong performance in recovering high-resolution thermal patterns, improving accuracy and robustness over existing methods.
